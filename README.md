# Captcha-Verification
Captcha Verification using Tkinter GUI

This is a simple GUI-based captcha verification system that displays random images to the user and asks them to select all images that contain a specific object. The GUI was built using the Tkinter module in Python.

My friend @ChethanAddetla and I collaborated closely on our College 3rd semester project, and both of us made significant contributions to its successful completion.


# Getting Started

To run this code on your local machine, you need to have Python 3 and the following modules installed:

    tkinter
    ttk
    PIL
    
# How it Works

When you run the code, a window will appear with a set of random images. The user is required to select all images that contain a specific object. The object is chosen randomly from a predefined set of objects.

Once the user has selected the images, they can click on the "Verify" button to verify their selection. If their selection is correct, a message will be displayed indicating that the user has passed the captcha test. Otherwise, a message will be displayed indicating that the user has failed the test.
